## TypeScript Express Template

A simple skeleton with sensible defaults to start developing with TS + Express (node.js 22).
Includes:

- Logging with Winston
- Typed env configuration in environment.d.ts, using Dotenv
- Extended response headers via Helmet
- Esbuild to produce a single JS file as the production build
- End-to-end Dockerfile
- Testing with Vitest and Supertest (+ coverage reporting)
- Hot reload dev server
